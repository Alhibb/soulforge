## :pencil: Application Process

> **:loudspeaker:** The grants are distributed in milestones, with disbursements occurring upon the completion of 85% of the defined milestones. The grants will be distributed in USDT or USDC and sent to KYC/AML verified wallets, preferably exchange wallets. The funds are strictly to be used for the development and testing of the application and may also be utilized to incentivize open-source contributions. The grants must not be used for any DeFi activities.

### 1. Application Creation Process

 - [ ] **Fork this repository and create a copy**  
   [Fork](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge) grants program repository. In your fork, create a copy of the [application template](applications/application-template.md) under the `applications` directory. 
   ‚ö†Ô∏è *Do not modify the original template file directly*.

 - [ ] **Rename the duplicated file in the following format**  
   Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`. 
   Refer to this [sample application](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge/blob/main/applications/zkchess.md#zkchess) for guidance.

 - [ ] **Complete the Template:**  
   Fill out the template with your project details. The more comprehensive your information, the quicker the review. Check our [Grants Guidelines](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge?tab=readme-ov-file#-guidelines) to ensure your deliverables are detailed.

 - [ ] **Submit Your Application:**  
   Create a pull request with **only one new file**‚Äî the Markdown file you filled out.
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  *Please make sure you do not modify more than one file*.

 - [ ] **Spread the Word:**  
   When you're done, give us a shout-out on [X](https://x.com/zk_bankai), We Would love to share your contributions ahead ü©µ

*Read Our [FAQs](docs/faq.md).*

### 2. Application Review Process

   1. The [committee](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-team) can (and usually does) issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
   2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments _need to be included in the application_. You may address feedback by directly modifying your application and leaving a comment once you're done. Generally, if you don't reply within 2 weeks, the application will be closed due to inactivity, but you're always free to reopen it as long as it hasn't been rejected.
   3. When all requested changes are addressed and the terms and conditions have been signed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` and share it internally with the rest of the committee.
   4. The application will be accepted and merged as soon as it receives internal team members' approval. Usually, this will not take longer than 14-20 days.

## Important Notes

1. **Grant Independence**: While some links may point to established projects, please note that SoulForge grant applications are often independent initiatives, separate from other work conducted by the teams.

2. **Terminations**: This page includes information about grants terminated due to breaches of the SoulForge grant program terms. However, it's important to note that teams may choose to discontinue work on a grant for various reasons without terminating the project itself. Such decisions are not reflected in this overview.

3. **Application vs. Delivery**: There is a clear distinction between a grant application being accepted and the successful delivery of the project. Acceptance does not guarantee successful completion.

4. **Public Announcements**: Only teams that have successfully delivered a milestone are authorized to make public announcements about their SoulForge grant.

5. **Regular Updates**: This page is updated regularly to reflect the most current status of each grant project.
