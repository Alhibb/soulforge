# SoulForge Application Process

> üì¢ **Important:** Please follow the steps below to apply. You can find detailed guidelines, payment, and delivery instructions [here](https://soulforge.zkbankai.com). If you have any specific questions or need clarification, feel free to ask in the [**chat here**](https://t.me/zkbankaiSoulforge).

### 1. Application Submission Process

- [ ] **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the [SoulForge Grants repository](https://github.com/zk-bankai/SoulForge). In your fork, create a copy of the [application template](https://github.com/zk-bankai/soulforge/blob/main/applications/application-template.md) located under the `applications` directory.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not modify the original template file directly.**
  
- [ ] **Rename the File:** Rename your newly duplicated file using your project name. The format should be: `project_name.md`.

- [ ] **Complete the Application Template:** Fill in the template with all the relevant details about your project. More detailed and comprehensive submissions result in faster reviews.  

	Be sure to follow the [Grants Guidelines mentioned here](https://soulforge.zkbankai.com/) to ensure your deliverables are clear and well-defined.

- [ ] **Submit Your Application:** Open a pull request that includes **only one file**‚Äîyour completed Markdown file.  ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not make changes to any other files.**

- [ ] **Publicize Your Submission:** After submitting, give us a shout-out on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/zk_bankai). We‚Äôre excited to highlight your contributions! ü©µ

### 2. Application Review Process

- Once the pull request is submitted the SoulForge Review Committee may leave comments or request changes on your pull request.

- Requested clarifications or updates should be made directly in the application document. Please make sure feedback is promptly addressed. Inactivity for over two weeks may result in the application being closed, but you may reopen it at any time unless it has been formally rejected.

- Once all changes are made, a team member will mark the application as `ready for review` and submit it for internal evaluation.

- If approved by the Grant Evaluators, the application's details will be added to the [`Accepted Grants Applications`](https://github.com/zk-bankai/soulforge/edit/main/README.md#accepted-grant-applications) section. The approval process generally takes 14-20 days.

## Important Notes

- **Independence of Grants:** While some projects may be associated with larger initiatives, the applications submitted to SoulForge are considered independent and separate from any other ongoing work of the teams involved.

- **Terminations:** This page reflects the status of any terminated grants due to violations of the SoulForge terms. Teams may also discontinue a grant voluntarily without necessarily terminating the overall project. Such decisions will not be reflected here.

- **Grant Application ‚â† Project Delivery:** Acceptance of a grant application does not guarantee the project's successful completion. Delivering the project is the ultimate goal, and teams must meet milestones for full completion.

- **Public Announcements:** Teams are permitted to make public announcements about their SoulForge grant acceptance only after their project has been added to the Accepted Grant Applications section.
